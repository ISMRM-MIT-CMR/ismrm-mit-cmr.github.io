Please sign in with the password received from the conference. Then, type in your full name (first name & last name) as you first enter the space so others can recognize you (this is your conference badge!). You will find the tutorial spaces to your left as you enter the Mount Seymour lobby. 


1Ô∏è‚É£ At the **beginning of the session**, please go inside the **Discovery lecture hall** and **join the Zoom call** for instructions. You can join the zoom call by clicking "x" as soon as you see a "telephone" sign lighting up yellow. Please note: in some browsers it may be necessary to mute yourself in gather.town as you join the zoom call. The first part of the session will consist of presentations of the solutions and the award ceremony itself. 

**The presentation can also be viewed live outside of gather.town by following the link provided by ISMRM for this session.**
